A Jekyll theme based on the Hugo theme Archie by @athul.

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-archie"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-archie
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-archie

## Usage

I will release a template repository to use with this theme.

Meanwhile you can use the `_BLANK_config.yml` as a starting point for your config.



## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml ` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.
